# Program Requirements
# Use the Flight Search and Sheety API to populate your own copy of the Google Sheet
# with International Air Transport Association (IATA) codes for each city.
# Most of the cities in the sheet include multiple airports, you want the city code (not the airport code see here).
#
# Use the Flight Search API to check for the cheapest flights from tomorrow to 6 months later for all the cities in the Google Sheet.
#
# If the price is lower than the lowest price listed in the Google Sheet then send an SMS (or WhatsApp Message)
# to your own number using the Twilio API.
#
# The SMS should include
# the departure airport IATA code,
# destination airport IATA code,
# flight price and
# flight dates. e.g.
